## Referral System
The referral system is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage referrals for medical services. It facilitates the seamless transfer of patients from one healthcare provider to another, ensuring efficient coordination and continuity of care.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: The system provides user authentication functionality to ensure secure access to the referral system. Users can register, login, and manage their account credentials.
    
-   **Worklist**: The worklist displays a list of patients awaiting referral. It provides an overview of patients' information such as name, age, contact details, and referral status.
    
-   **Referral Form**: The referral form enables users to create new referral requests. It includes various sections for capturing patient details, next of kin information, referring officer details, service details, and additional notes.
    
-   **Dynamic Pre-filling**: When selecting a patient from the worklist, the referral form dynamically pre-fills the patient's information, such as name, gender, telephone number, ID number, county, and other demographics.
    
-   **Validation and Error Handling**: The system performs validation checks on form inputs to ensure data integrity and accuracy. It provides error messages and feedback to users for any incorrect or missing information.
